          <p> This was a app made in a group for COM S 309. The goal was to make an app that can view the courses on ISU, and allow you to create the 4 year plan in the app. It will also check for prereqs and notify you of any missing ones.</p>
          <p> In the process of making this app it was the first time I worked with other people on a GitLab repository where everyone pushed their part of the app to. I learned that it was very important to work out the details ahead of time when you're relying on someone else for a part of the program, like the server, for example. Or else it might not work with your part of the app in the end.</p>
          <p> This was the first time I wrote code in Android Studio, and I learned about the basics of making an android app alongside server communication technologies in the process. </p>

          <p> This is a personal project of mine that started as a simple Java project. It was controlled by text commands in a terminal, and it would print a new board every time you moved. After having used Android Studio in COM S 309, I had the idea of porting this to Android.</p>
          <p> Android Studio also used Java, so I started with the code I wrote for the java program, and moved them around to make sure they worked within the android app. All the popup windows and the code for them was from scratch, and real time updating of text in the windows also caused some issues at first. </p>

          <h1> Ethics </h1>
          <div class="essay">
            <p>I think it's important to have a code of ethics so that people have a guide to what they should and shouldn't do. Of course, they could choose to not follow it, but then there could be consequences for their actions, now that the code is established. If I have to deal with an issue related to ethics, I would first think about how it effects other people, and if it's morally correct to do so. One example would be prioritizing profits over direct loss of human life, in the case of the Ford Pinto and its dangerous fuel tank. During the discussions, some issues came up, such as human lives vs profits, privacy concerns with smart home devices, and running experiments on unsuspecting humans that made them depressed. In general, we agreed that the consumer should be put first, and precautions should be made so that they aren't intentionally harmed or be put in places of danger by the product they are using. And that saving a couple dollars per vehicle shouldn't be prioritized over a car catching on fire from a 20mph rear end collision, with the Ford Pinto again as example. </p>
            <p>I did my case study on the Ford Pinto and it's faulty fuel tank, and I think integrity, honesty, and responsibility match up the best in this case. I think these three complement each other between the multiple different parties involved. First of all, it's the higher ups that gave the go-ahead to put the car into production, knowing that it has design flaws and can easily ignite when hit from behind. And then to a lesser extent the engineers that didn't push for design fixes. I think both of these relate to integrity and responsibility, both as a designer and a producer of items that have the potential to cause harm to human lives. As for honesty, just the company hiding the fact that the car has the potential to ignite in an otherwise "normal" accident. The other item points I don't think match up as much since they're more "individual" compared to a group of people that put out the product. As for one more virtue, I think that might be compassion, since some people actually thought this was better than having the issue fixed, as it technically "saves money" to make the payments when people die or get injured, instead of fixing the issue in the first place.</p>

          <h1> Gen ed </h1>
          <div class="essay">
            <p>First hearing about the gen ed courses I was sceptical, with it not related to the actual major, but I did get some very useful information in one of the classes.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>HDFS 378, finantal planning. I first heard about this course from a friend, and apparently, it counted as US Diversity, and this was the first time I heard of a class that counted that I was interested in. Taking the course was a big help in learning about the different financial options to plan for retirement. An option I’ve never heard of before is an investment type of life insurance, where you put money into a life insurance policy, and the company invests it for you. This will be less overall than investing yourself without the policy since the company also takes their cut off the top. It does mean you now have a constant life insurance policy throughout the investment period which might be a plus for some people if they have people depending on them to live their life. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This course also filled the gap in college and life in a big way, where if you take this class you’ve basically learned about most of the retirement or investment methods, different stock investment strategies, 401k, mutual fund, Roth ira, and more. I think this is a very important class for everyone, regardless of its status as a gen ed or a class that satisfies the us diversity requirement for graduation.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>For all the people saying that you don’t get to learn about life skills I university, I think this class would be a powerful rebuttal, though I don’t think many people outside the human sciences class have heard of this class or what it provides. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>I think one thing ISU needs is a way for people to learn about gen eds. When I was first choosing what gen eds to take all that was available was a document with all the class codes and the names listed. While you can get an idea of what some classes provide, it is definitely easy to miss the ones that could be useful for people out of university.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>CJ ST 240</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>ECON 101</p>
            <p>Econ 101 microeconomics was a class I heard weekly in the broadcasts while going to Ames High School. I believe these courses were available to high school students with a sign up sheet, which they would tell people to fill out if they want to take these classes. I thought it would be interesting to take the class to see what it was about.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Supply, demand and how the market works in general is also ver important, as it also explains how the stock market works. Another kind of timely thing was that when I took the class, cryptocurrencies such as ethereu and bitcoin was on their way up and up, which was also an interesting topic for the class.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>RUS 375</p>
            <p>My timing for taking rus 375 was a pretty weird one. I needed a course to fill the second half semester after I dropped another course, and two days after I added the course the Russian-Ukraine war broke out. This interesting timing made discussions very interesting since it was on the news nonstop for the first while. In the final essay, I got to look into the food production of the two countries, and what effects the war had on the global supply of multiple items such as sunflower oil, npk fertilizer, and various grains, all of which Ukraine, Russia, or both are big producers of. It turns out, some countries import these exclusively from the countries in war, which makes them vulnerable to supply issues or have to find alternative products.</p>
