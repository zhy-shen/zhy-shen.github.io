            Due to the nature of this senior design project, it is hard to say what firm position I have in it. The goal of the project is to produce a set of documentation or turorials for Industrial Design students with the goal of them being able to program and incorprate Arduinos in their design projects.             </p>
          <p>
            The main dificulty of the project is that there is no supplied specification for the project like most other senior design projects. We have to talk with Idustrial Design students to hear their needs and what they are comfortable with doing coding side. Also that design students have a different way of thinking compared to most engineering students who have been implementing set specifications most of the time for projects and such.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the project, the team will interact with Industrial Design students and faculty to see what the needs are and plan accordingly. In the end, we will hopefully have material to be able to adapt into a course for Industrial Design students to take and they will come out being able to incorprate Arduinos into their designs.

          <p> This was a app made in a group for COM S 309. The goal was to make an app that can view the courses on ISU, and allow you to create the 4 year plan in the app. It will also check for prereqs and notify you of any missing ones.</p>
          <p> In the process of making this app it was the first time I worked with other people on a GitLab repository where everyone pushed their part of the app to. I learned that it was very important to work out the details ahead of time when you're relying on someone else for a part of the program, like the server, for example. Or else it might not work with your part of the app in the end.</p>
          <p> This was the first time I wrote code in Android Studio, and I learned about the basics of making an android app alongside server communication technologies in the process. </p>

          <p> Android Studio also used Java, so I started with the code I wrote for the java program, and moved them around to make sure they worked within the android app. All the popup windows and the code for them was from scratch, and real time updating of text in the windows also caused some issues at first. </p>

            When I took the course, the in person Roombas were unfortunately not available, and everyone had to resort to an Roomba simulator. While this was less interesting than the real thing, in the end everything still worked out.
          </p>
          <p> As for the project itself, it was for CPRE 288, where we had to load software onto a Roomba for it to do various tasks, with the final goal of having it autonomously traverse terrain towards the goal on a playfield.</p>
          <p>
            This project utilized C as the programming language, as well as low level code for the Texas Instrument's Tiva Microprocessor. Every necessary sensor and motor had to be initialized with register locations on the microprocessor, which was definitly a challenge to grasp at first.

          <h1> Ethics Essay </h1>
          <div class="essay">
            <p>I think it's important to have a code of ethics so that people have a guide to what they should and shouldn't do. Of course, they could choose to not follow it, but then there could be consequences for their actions, now that the code is established. If I have to deal with an issue related to ethics, I would first think about how it effects other people, and if it's morally correct to do so. One example would be prioritizing profits over direct loss of human life, in the case of the Ford Pinto and its dangerous fuel tank. During the discussions, some issues came up, such as human lives vs profits, privacy concerns with smart home devices, and running experiments on unsuspecting humans that made them depressed. In general, we agreed that the consumer should be put first, and precautions should be made so that they aren't intentionally harmed or be put in places of danger by the product they are using. And that saving a couple dollars per vehicle shouldn't be prioritized over a car catching on fire from a 20mph rear end collision, with the Ford Pinto again as example. </p>
            <p>I did my case study on the Ford Pinto and it's faulty fuel tank, and I think integrity, honesty, and responsibility match up the best in this case. I think these three complement each other between the multiple different parties involved. First of all, it's the higher ups that gave the go-ahead to put the car into production, knowing that it has design flaws and can easily ignite when hit from behind. And then to a lesser extent the engineers that didn't push for design fixes. I think both of these relate to integrity and responsibility, both as a designer and a producer of items that have the potential to cause harm to human lives. As for honesty, just the company hiding the fact that the car has the potential to ignite in an otherwise "normal" accident. The other item points I don't think match up as much since they're more "individual" compared to a group of people that put out the product. As for one more virtue, I think that might be compassion, since some people actually thought this was better than having the issue fixed, as it technically "saves money" to make the payments when people die or get injured, instead of fixing the issue in the first place.</p>

          <h1> Cumulative Reflection </h1>
          <div class="essay">
            <p>Having lived in Ames for half my life, choosing Iowa State to further my education was a no-brainer. I have always been interested in computers and other technology growing up. At the time, not knowing much of the difference between Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Software Engineering, I picked the one that sounded closest to what I like to do, building computers.</p>

<p>I already took AP Calc in high school, but I chose to retake Calc 165 since people recommended doing it to have an easier intro into college. The style of classes in university is very different from that of high school, where classes are scattered all across campus and in many different buildings.</p>

<p>Another class I also took in high school was a computer science course about Java. Back then, I just could not wrap my head around how object-oriented programming worked and just programming in general. The two intro programming classes for computer engineering at Iowa State were CPRE 185 and COMS 227, for C and Java, respectively. I felt that these two classes helped me understand how programming and object-oriented things worked and let me expand and learn other things later.</p>

<p>One class I did not like taking at ISU was physics 2. I should have listened when people suggested taking it at Iowa Western as an online course instead of ISU, and I should’ve taken that advice when I was scheduling classes in the second year. I am glad that physics 2 is no longer required in the computer engineering curriculum.</p>

<p>Halfway through the second semester at ISU, covid happened, and along with the two semesters afterward, most classes moved online. I feel that this was very much a lost opportunity for building relationships with faculty and the like since face-to-face interactions ceased to exist. This also happened to be when I took Physics 2, which made that course even worse for me, and I just could not keep up with the course. All in all, the covid semesters just felt like a wash. Not much to look back on for the two and a half semesters that it happened.</p>

<p>Looking back, it definitely would’ve been more beneficial to take more gen eds in the early semesters, as I think I only had 15 and 14 credits for the first two semesters, which almost ended up in me running out of time to take all the needed classes in the four years before graduation.</p>

<p>Things into Junior year were definitely better, with group projects happening and courses returning to the way they were in Freshman year for me before covid. COM S 309 where we built an Android app in a group is definitely my favorite since I knew all the people that were in that group with me.</p>

<p>In the summer after Junior year, I got an internship at a software company, and while unexpected for me, I worked on the website. It was definitely different being in a workplace, with other people you have to work with. The first couple of weeks I’ve probably spent more time on StackOverflow than anywhere else searching for stuff. For the website files, everything was version-controlled. Having used git from COM S 309 and knowing how it worked was definitely useful. Everything also went through a review process, and the first time getting something you’ve done through to a public-facing website is definitely exciting and rewarding.</p>

<p>The most notable thing in the Senior year so far is senior design. For my project, the goal is to help Industrial Design students learn about programming and specifically, the Arduino, to use sensors and collect data in their design projects. One thing really different about this project compared to the others I’ve done at ISU so far is that there’s no “specification” per se, as we have to find the best way to get educate, get them familiar with, and more importantly, interested in using and incorporating them into their designs. This is something me and my group are still in the process of figuring out.</p>

<p>More than a quarter of the way through Senior year, I am cautiously optimistic about the future. I feel like the programming classes definitely prepared me for the internship better than any other could, and without the career fair, I likely would not have even had the chance at an internship and build on everything I’ve learned up to that point.</p>

          <h1> General Education Reflection </h1>
          <div class="essay">
            <p>At first hearing about the General Education courses, I was skeptical as the classes did not pertain to the actual Computer Engineering major much at all, but I did find one of the courses very useful.</p>

<p>The first Gen Ed courses I took were CJST 240, Introduction to the U.S. Criminal Justice System, and ECON 101, Principles of Microeconomics.</p>

<p>Econ 101 microeconomics was a class I heard weekly in the broadcasts while going to Ames High School. I believe these courses were available to high school students with a signup sheet, which they would tell people to fill out if they wanted to take these classes. I thought it would be interesting to take the class to see what it was about. Supply, demand, and how the market works, in general, are also very important, as it explains how the stock market works. Another kind of timely thing was that when I took the class, cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and bitcoin were on their way up, which was also an interesting topic for the class.</p>

<p>As for CJST 240, I had heard from a friend who said it was pretty interesting. The information in the class was definitely interesting, but how much I would actually get to use out of college is questionable, though I knew that going into the course.</p>

<p>Next is the Gen Ed course I found the most useful, HDFS 378, Retirement Planning and Employee Benefits. Funnily enough, this requires 3 credits in economics, which at that point I was really relieved that I had already taken ECON 101.</p>

<p>I heard about it from a friend while scheduling courses, and apparently, it counted as US Diversity. This was the first time I heard of a class in that category that I was interested in. Taking the course was a big help in learning about the different financial options to plan for retirement. An option I’ve never heard of before is an investment type of life insurance, where you put money into a life insurance policy, and the company invests it for you. This will be less overall than investing yourself without the policy since the company also takes their cut off the top. It does mean you now have a constant life insurance policy throughout the investment period, which might be a plus for some people if they have people depending on them to live their life.</p>

<p>This course also fills the gap in college and life in a big way. The point where if you take this class, you’ve basically learned about most of the retirement or investment methods, different stock investment strategies, 401k, mutual funds, Roth ira, and more. I think this is a very important class for everyone, regardless of its status as a gen ed or a class that satisfies the us diversity requirement for graduation.</p>

<p>For all the people saying that you don’t get to learn about life skills in university, I think this class would be a powerful rebuttal, though I don’t think many people outside the human sciences class have heard of this class or what it provides.</p>

<p>I think one thing ISU needs is a way for people to learn about gen eds. When I first chose what gen eds to take, all that was available was a document with all the class codes and the names listed. While you can get an idea of what some classes provide, it is definitely easy to miss the ones that could be useful for people out of university.</p>

<p>Lastly is RUS 375, Russian Today. My timing for taking RUS 375 was a pretty weird one. I needed a course to fill the second half semester after I dropped another course, and two days after I added the course, the Russian-Ukraine war broke out. This unfortunate timing made discussions very interesting since it was on the news nonstop for the first couple of weeks. In the final essay, I got to look into the food production of the two countries and what effects the war had on the global supply of multiple items such as sunflower oil, npk fertilizer, and various grains, all of which Ukraine, Russia, or both are big producers of. It turns out some countries import these exclusively from the countries in war, which makes them vulnerable to supply issues or have to find alternative products.</p>

<p>Overall, I would say most of the General Education courses I took were useful in one way or another. Though HD FS 378 is still on a whole other level of usefulness compared to any other Gen Ed course I have taken, and most likely will take. Everyone should take HD FS 378.</p>
